# Positive Aspects of Using LZ4 in ZRAM:

1. Fast performance: High compression and decompression speed.


2. Low latency: Quick access to compressed data.


3. Moderate CPU usage: Preserves performance on devices with lower processing power.


4. Memory savings: Compresses data efficiently, freeing up RAM.

# Negative Aspects of Using LZ4 in ZRAM:

1. Lower compression ratio: Saves less space compared to algorithms like ZSTD.
